The Lassonde Computer Science Unofficial Guide - https://chrisngyn.github.io/LCSUG
## About
This is my take on making a survival guide to Computer Science at York University. I wanted to document all the things I learned over the years, answer common questions, and write all the things that I wish I knew when I was a first year student.  
  
I was heavily inspiring by seeing students from other universities make guides for their respective program, so I wanted to do something similar to give back to the community that I love so much. :heart:

## Contributing
I'll be posting issues overtime about things I need help with (i.e. missing course descriptions, requests for visual appearance updates, and more). If there's something not listed that you want to see added, make an issue or add me on Discord, **@chrispy#8933**. I'm open to accepting any PRs that will improve the LCSUG.
